What is Jenkins

Jenkins is widely employed as a crucial CI/CD tool for automating software development processes. Teams utilize Jenkins to automate building, testing, and deploying applications, streamlining the development lifecycle. With Jenkins pipelines, developers can define, version, and execute entire workflows as code, ensuring consistent and reproducible builds. Integration with version control systems allows Jenkins to trigger builds automatically upon code changes, facilitating early detection of issues and enabling teams to deliver high-quality software at a faster pace. Jenkins' flexibility, extensibility through plugins, and support for various tools make it a preferred choice for organizations aiming to implement efficient and automated DevOps practices.
